>> #### SEO

> ###### Meta Tags
`base.html` contains two metas - `name="description"`, and `name="keywords"`. Each of these tags add to the SEO optimization of the website by incorporating key words and a site description. 

> ###### sitemap.xml
To improve site navigation, a sitemap.xml file was created using [XML Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/). This file provides a comprehensive breakdown of `Leaf Lounge`'s links for search engine content discovery.

> ###### robots.txt
Additionally, a robots.txt file is provided for informing crawlers which directories they may crawl, with a link to the generated sitemap for a comprehensive breakdown. This file signals a level of search engine quality and improves the SEO ranking of the website.

>> #### Marketing Strategy
`Leaf Lounge` is a C2C solution, allowing users to sell their own books to other site users. Leaf Lounge also provides its own library for users to purchase books.

> ###### Planning
This website strives to create an engaging and interactive environment for readers and book enthusiasts to connect, network and broaden the outreach of new authors within various book communities. Several intuitive features in the navigation bar at the top of the page and considerable consideration given to the overall design and feel of the website make the user's experience pleasant and easy-going, link shopping in a book shop.

By adopting a similar layout to that of a bookstore, users visiting the library collection get fast access to all Leaf Lounge has to offer, while being able to partake in the same book-shopping experience from the comfort of their own homes.

To create a successful website, I needed to define and refine the types of users I would expect to visit this website, define the scope of the application for the period within which this site was to be delivered as a working product (i.e., before deadline), and define several marketing strategies to compliment the finished site, bearing in mind limitations with budget, time, user-reach, and user engagement (UIUX).

> ###### Scope of Application
Leaf Lounge Bookstore and Community Hub is a dynamic platform built on a Django backend, leveraging the high-level Python framework known for its rapid development capabilities and clean code practices. Enhanced with Bootstrap 5 for modern and responsive design, Leaf Lounge serves as a networking space for book enthusiasts to connect, share impressions, reviews, and critiques. Membership is simple: by purchasing a book and creating an account, visitors gain immediate access to their personal profile and the full range of community features. Registered users also have the opportunity to become Leaf Lounge authors by setting up an author profile and uploading their published works to the Leaf Lounge library, further enriching the community experience.

The application comes packed with the following functionality and features:
  - Robust E-Commerce integration with Stripe payments.
  - Search and Filter Books for quick and easy access to your favourite works.
  - Engaging and interactive UI for a real-life online library experience.
  - A dedicated contact page for handling user queries.
  - User profiles for storing, managing, and amending data for personalised and streamlined experiences.
  - Community Forums for connecting and engaging with like-minded book enthusiasts and genre fanatics.

> ###### Target Audience
`Readers` `Authors` `Publishers` `Book Critics` `Book Enthusiasts` `Users 15+ years of age (payment)`.

>> #### Marketing Strategies

> ###### Social Media

As part of the social media marketing strategy, a [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61563390085042). was created for the Leaf Lounge community.
The profile picture is of the `Leaf Lounge` logo, building brand recognition, with a relevant cover photo. A single post was made as part of an introduction to the website, with a link to the deployed version, (and a warning message telling users to not input any banking information into the checkout).

> ###### Email Marketing (MailChimp Newsletter)
As part of the email marketing strategy, a newsletter form is provided at the bottom of the footer for users to sign up to the `Leaf Lounge` Newsletter. This is ideal for a small business and users may unsubscribe at any point from any page by toggling the form. This service was free to set up.

Other Marketing strategies were not implemented as the majority required payment, which is beyond the scope of this fictitious college project.
